						just a few weeks ago,</p> <p class="lead">Ted Kellum told his wife that he felt like they lived in paradise.</p>

						<p>After relocating to the Santa Clarita area from Texas for his new job as a defense contractor at Raytheon, Kellum and his family settled into their home two years ago on Sand Canyon Road. It came with a pool and a striking view of the San Gabriel Mountains.

						<blockquote>But then, this weekend, Kellum, 55, watched as the area transformed into an inferno. Dark smoke choked the air and orange flames traced a ridge behind the home that he loves.

						By Saturday afternoon, he started to worry about how quickly the Sand fire was moving. He called to give his wife an update.

						“This is getting out of control,” he told her. “We’re leaving.”	After packing up pictures, clothes and iPads -- as well as two dogs, a cat and a guinea pig -- the family headed to William S. Hart High School in Santa Clarita, where they spent the night in the gymnasium with no air conditioning. Early Sunday, they still didn’t know much. Was their home among the 18 structures that had burned down? Was it the one that was damaged?
